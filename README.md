# Learning Storybook.js

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) lets you do things like a living documentation library that demos isolated interactive components. It also lets you test components without, say, needing to create a new page/route to hold test components and data. Example: <https://airbnb.io/react-dates>
